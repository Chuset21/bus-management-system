# Bus Management System

A bus management system built for a college assignment.

## Requirements
- Java 17

## Running
Make sure to download the jar file in the jar directory.  
Open your preferred terminal.
cd into the directory where this jar is stored (it doesn't have to be stored anywhere specific) `cd some-directory`  
In the command line run: `java -jar bus-management-system-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## Using
Pass arguments separated by spaces/tabs.  
If you would like to pass an argument containing white space please make sure to surround the argument with quotation marks, like so __"\<argument>"__.

## Colors
I suggest using a console that supports ANSI coloring, if you don't know if your console supports it, don't worry,  
there is a prompt that will make you aware if your console supports it or not.  
Known consoles to not support ANSI:
 - Command prompt  
 - Windows Powershell  

Known consoles to support ANSI:
- Most Unix consoles  
- IntelliJ console  
- [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal)  

This is what it looks like on my IntelliJ console which supports ANSI coloring, the best coloring I've seen on Windows.
